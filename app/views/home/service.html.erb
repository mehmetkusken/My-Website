<h2>Ecommerce Websites</h2>
<p>Build an eCommerce website and you can provide customers with a seamless shopping experience, allowing them to effortlessly browse, select and purchase products that capture their interest. You can sell your own creations or dropship products from your online store. The best eCommerce websites make the buying experience as easy as possible by offering product pages with robust imagery, enticing product descriptions and multiple payment options for you to set up your own online marketplace. </p>

<h2>Business Websites</h2>
<p>Even if you don't plan on selling anything in an online store, a website is still helpful for establishing an online presence,  building your brand and advancing your entrepreneurship goals. When building a business website, whether for B2B or B2C, focus on the needs of your customers and explain how your company will solve their unique challenges.</p>

<h2> Blog Websites</h2>
<p>Starting a blog provides a platform to share written, visual and digital content about your interests. Once you’re up and running, you might even see opportunities for monetization, such as affiliate marketing, display advertising and selling ad space. You can also share directly from your blog to your social media platforms and accounts. </p>

<h2>Personal Websites</h2>
<p>Whereas a portfolio website is useful for showcasing your work, a personal website is a space where you can truly be yourself. Build one to share your accomplishments, explore your interests or develop your personal brand. What you include on your personal website and web pages depends on your goals. If you’re using it to advance your career, include a resume, clips and a bio. If you’re making it for self-expression, a blog and social links might be all you need.</p>

<h2>Nonprofit Websites</h2>
<p>Nonprofit websites let you share your organization's mission, vision and core values so you can activate people around your cause. For example, church websites can help you reach new and existing congregation members, while animal rescue or healthcare websites can attract donors who can further your mission.</p>

<h2>Educational Websites</h2>
<p>These online resources aren’t just for primary schools and universities. School websites can also offer online teaching and information about businesses that teach things like music or foreign languages. An ideal school website design will serve as an online database for students, parents and faculty. You can also incorporate educational technology and provide online lessons or assignments for students. It’ll also encourage prospective students to enroll.</p>
